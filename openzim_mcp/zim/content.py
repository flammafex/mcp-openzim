"""Content-retrieval methods for ``ZimOperations``.

This mixin holds the entry-content reading surface — single entry, batch
entries, binary entries, summaries, and snippets. Methods run as instance
methods of ``ZimOperations`` via the mixin pattern.

``zim_archive``, ``Searcher``, ``Query`` etc. are accessed through
``openzim_mcp.zim_operations`` so existing test patches against the
shim's symbols continue to work without changes.
