"""Simple tools implementation for OpenZIM MCP server.

This module provides intelligent, natural language-based tools that abstract
away the complexity of multiple specialized tools. Designed for LLMs with
limited tool-calling capabilities or context windows.

The regex-heavy intent-parsing layer lives in :mod:`openzim_mcp.intent_parser`.
``IntentParser``, ``safe_regex_search`` and ``safe_regex_findall`` are
re-exported here for backward-compatibility with existing imports.

        Opens archives using ExitStack (clean lifecycle, no leaks), calls

        Archive resolution:
          - If zim_file_path is provided, validate and open that single archive.
          - Otherwise, discover all ZIM files via list_zim_files_data() and

        search_handler is self.zim_operations — ZimOperations has search_top_k
        directly, satisfying the synthesize pipeline's duck-typed interface.

        D5 fix: strip natural-language interrogative prefixes ("tell me
        about", "who is", "what are", …) before handing the query to
        the search stage. Without the strip, ``synthesize=True`` with
        query ``"tell me about Berlin"`` BM25-matched on the words
        "tell" + "me" + "about" + "Berlin" and returned songs by Irving
        Berlin / Nat King Cole albums / Hans Abrahamsen pieces.
        Re-using ``IntentParser`` keeps prefix detection in one place
