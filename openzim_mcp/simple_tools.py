"""Simple tools implementation for OpenZIM MCP server.

This module provides intelligent, natural language-based tools that abstract
away the complexity of multiple specialized tools. Designed for LLMs with
limited tool-calling capabilities or context windows.

The regex-heavy intent-parsing layer lives in :mod:`openzim_mcp.intent_parser`.
``IntentParser``, ``safe_regex_search`` and ``safe_regex_findall`` are
re-exported here for backward-compatibility with existing imports.

          - If zim_file_path is provided, validate and open that single archive.

        D5 fix: strip natural-language interrogative prefixes ("tell me
